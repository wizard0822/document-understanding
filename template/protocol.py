# TODO(developer): Rewrite with your protocol definition.

# This is the protocol for the dummy miner and validator.
# It is a simple request-response protocol where the validator sends a request
# to the miner, and the miner responds with a dummy response.

# ---- miner ----
# Example usage:
#   def dummy( synapse: Dummy ) -> Dummy:
#       synapse.dummy_output = synapse.dummy_input + 1
#       return synapse
#   axon = bt.axon().attach( dummy ).serve(netuid=...).start()

# ---- validator ---
# Example usage:
#   dendrite = bt.dendrite()
#   dummy_output = dendrite.query( Dummy( dummy_input = 1 ) )
#   assert dummy_output == 2

class ProfileSynapse(bt.Synapse):
    """
    The ProfileSynapse subclass of the Synapse class encapsulates the functionalities related to Identification Scenarios.

    It specifies seven fields - `id`, `label`, `type`, `options`, `value`, `image`, `answer` - that define the state of the ProfileSynapse object.
    All of the fields except `answer` are read-only fields defined during object initialization, and `answer` is a mutable
    field that can be updated as the scenario progresses.

    The Config inner class specifies that assignment validation should occur on this class (validate_assignment = True),
    meaning value assignments to the instance fields are checked against their defined types for correctness.

    Attributes:
        id (str): A unique identifier for the task. This field is both mandatory and immutable.
        type (str): A string that specifies the type of the task. This field is both mandatory and immutable and can take values "Generated" and "User" only.
        img_path (str): a string that is actually a path to image
        score (float): A string that captures the score to the profile. This field is mutable.


    Methods:
        deserialize() -> "ProfileSynapse": Returns the instance of the current object.


    The `ProfileSynapse` class also overrides the `deserialize` method, returning the
    instance itself when this method is invoked. Additionally, it provides a `Config`
    inner class that enforces the validation of assignments (`validate_assignment = True`).
